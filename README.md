# Mobile Personal Register with SQLite

## Overview

The **Mobile Personal Register** is a cross-platform mobile application developed using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/), designed to facilitate the creation, storage, and management of personal user records directly on a device.  
The application leverages **SQLite** as its local database engine, ensuring that all data is stored securely and remains accessible offline without reliance on external servers.

This project serves as both a practical utility and a demonstrative implementation of persistent local storage in mobile applications, showcasing structured database operations, modularized code organization, and a clean architectural approach.
